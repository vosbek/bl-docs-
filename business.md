- Developers spend 20-40 minutes crafting each detailed Jira card
- Requirements gathering is manual and often incomplete
- Acceptance criteria are frequently vague or missing
- Technical specifications require extensive research

**Quality Inconsistency:**
- Card quality varies dramatically across team members
- Junior developers struggle with comprehensive requirement analysis
- Missing edge cases and technical considerations
- Inconsistent formatting and structure

**Process Friction:**
- Developers avoid creating cards due to time investment
- Rushed card creation leads to scope creep during development
- Constant back-and-forth for clarification during sprints
- Poor cards result in implementation delays and rework

**Organizational Impact:**
- Project timelines suffer from inadequate planning
- Technical debt accumulates from rushed implementations
- Sprint velocity decreases due to unclear requirements

## Proposed Solution

### The AI-Assisted Workflow

Our system replaces manual card creation with an intelligent, guided process:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Raw Task<br/>30 seconds] --> B[AI Questions<br/>2 minutes] 
    B --> C[AI Answers<br/>2 minutes]
    C --> D[Final Card<br/>1 minute]
    
    style A fill:#ffcccb
    style B fill:#ffffcc
    style C fill:#ffffcc
    style D fill:#ccffcc

**Traditional Process (30-45 minutes):**
1. Analyze requirements manually (10-15 min)
2. Research technical considerations (10-15 min)
3. Write acceptance criteria (5-10 min)
4. Format and review card (5-10 min)

**AI-Assisted Process (5-8 minutes):**
1. Select task from list (30 seconds)
